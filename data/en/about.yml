title   : Why We are Different
description: >
  <p>
  We believe automatic contact tracing will be a valuable tool in fighting SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.
  However, such a solution should and can be realized without having to give up privacy. That is what we want to achieve with <b>ito</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b>ito</b> is built by people like you. We merged from several teams that participated in the #WirVsVirus Hackathon in March 2020. Since then, we have been joined by many other interested professionals and companies.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each country has a unique health system, which is why many different contact tracing apps are emerging.
  As people can contract viruses across borders we need a secure bridge for users of different apps to be notified independent of the app they are using.
  This is why <b>ito</b> and other teams are currently actively forming a global alliance of privacy-focused open source projects working on decentralized tracing solutions.
  The goal of this work is to create a unanimous privacy-protecting protocol that different countries and institutions can build their contact tracing apps on.

      Not every solution is created by people who are paid for it, ito  is one of those. We all work pro-bono and voluntarily to help society handle this outbreak. 
      Nothing will happen if nobody fights for it, that is the reason why we all found each other. 
      Global interoperability of COVID19 contact tracing protocols is crucial, and we are working to achieve this.
      Our team thinks globally and is ready to do more.

    description: > 
      We want a free solution for anyone and everyone. COVID19 knows no boundaries and nor do we. 
      Therefore we have to go beyond all these boundaries and local solutions and work together to find a global one. 
      ito  is currently in the process of forming a global alliance with privacy-focused open source projects. If you're interested, get in touch and join us!
