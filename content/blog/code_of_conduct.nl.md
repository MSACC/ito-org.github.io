## Gedragsregels

Transparency, traceability and privacy are our highest priorities. It is important to us to communicate in a transparent way with all our members, partners and users of the app and to share the measures we take to protect their data. The code of conduct provides information on how data is generated, used and processed as well as the ethical ground we operate on. Since it is an open source project, this documentation should also communicate our standards to all partners and otherwise associated parties.

  * Clear and non-violent communication
  * Integrative behaviour
  * Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  * Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  * Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
  * Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Onaanvaardbaar gedrag

  * The use of discriminating language or imagery
  * Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
  * personal or political attacks
  * Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Schenden van de regels

In case of violations of the code of conduct the team will conduct a prompt investigation of the incident. Depending on the severity the affected people will receive a warning and be asked - if possible - to reverse their actions and not to repeat the behavior. In case of several violations by the same person / institution of a severe illegal violation legal action will be taken.
